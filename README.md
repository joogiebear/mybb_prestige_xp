# Prestige XP for MyBB

**Prestige XP** is a MyBB plugin that adds a fully configurable XP and leveling system to your forum.  
Members earn XP for creating threads and posts, level up as they reach milestones, and display their progress directly on their postbit and profile.

## ðŸ–¥ Usage

- Members will **start at Level 0** with 0 XP.
- When they post or create threads, XP will be added automatically.
- Levels are calculated based on the XP thresholds you set in the settings.
- The XP bar on the profile page shows **progress toward the next level**.

## ðŸŽ¨ Customization

- **Move postbit display** â€” edit the `prestige_xp_postbit` template and place `{$prestige_xp}` anywhere inside your postbit template (`postbit` or `postbit_classic`).
- **Add Font Awesome icons** â€” simply edit the template and insert your `<i class="fa-solid fa-trophy"></i>` before `Level: {$prestige_level}`.
- **Change colors/styles** â€” modify the inline styles in the templates or move them to your themeâ€™s CSS file.

## ðŸ›  Editing

All front-end HTML is handled via MyBB templates, so no PHP editing is required for visual changes.  
If you want to change how XP is awarded (e.g., different values for different forums), you can modify the awarding logic inside `prestige_xp.php`.
