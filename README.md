# Prestige XP for MyBB

## ðŸŽ¨ Template Examples

### 1. Basic Level Display (Postbit)
```html
<br />
<span class="smalltext prestige-xp-level" data-level="{$prestige_level}">
    Level: {$prestige_level}
</span>

With Fontawesome
<br />
<span class="smalltext prestige-xp-level" data-level="{$prestige_level}">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-trophy" style="color: gold; margin-right: 6px;"></i>
    Level: {$prestige_level}
</span>
```


## ðŸ›  Editing

All front-end HTML is handled via MyBB templates, so no PHP editing is required for visual changes.
If you want to change how XP is awarded (e.g., different values for different forums), you can modify the awarding logic inside prestige_xp.php.
